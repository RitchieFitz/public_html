				<p>
					The world's premier music publication,
					<span style="font-weight: 900; font-style: italic;">Billboard Top Ten</span> 
					has served the entertainment business since 1894. Beginning as a weekly for the billposting and 
					advertising business, 
					<span style="font-weight: 900; font-style: italic;">Billboard Top Ten</span> 
					and its popular music charts have evolved into the primary source of information 
					on trends and innovation in music, serving music fans, artists, top executives, 
					tour promoters, publishers, radio programmers, lawyers, retailers, digital 
					entrepreneurs and many others.
				</p>
				<p>
					As <span style="font-weight: 900; font-style: italic;">Billboard Top Ten</span>'s 
					consumer-faced online home, 
					<span style="font-weight: 900; font-style: italic;">Billboard Top Ten.com</span> 
					features an extensive array of searchable, playable charts, breaking music news, artist 
					interviews and exclusives, news, video and more. Launched in 1995 as 
					<span style="font-weight: 900; font-style: italic;">Billboard Top Five</span>, 
					<span style="font-weight: 900; font-style: italic;">BillboardTopTen</span>.com now attracts 
					well over ten million unique visitors each month in more than 100 countries and has become 
					the de facto digital destination for popular music.
				</p>
				<p>
					When was the last time you fell in love with a new artist or song? At 
					Billboard Top Ten, we have a single mission: To play only music you'll love. (
					OK, we've added comedy as well so we're also up for playing some jokes you'll 
					love.) To understand just how we do this, and why we think we do it really, 
					really well, you need to know about the Music Genome Project.
				</p>
				<p>
					Together our team of musician-analysts has been listening to music, one song 
					at a time, studying and collecting literally hundreds of musical details on 
					every track - melody, harmony, instrumentation, rhythm, vocals, lyrics ... 
					and more! We continue this work every day to keep up with the incredible flow 
					of great new music coming from studios, stadiums and garages around the 
					country.
				</p>
				<p>
					With Billboard Top Ten you can explore this vast trove of music to your 
					heart's content. Just drop the name of one of your favorite songs, artists or 
					genres into Billboard Top Ten and let the Music Genome Project go. It will 
					quickly scan its entire world of analyzed music, almost a century of popular 
					recordings - new and old, well known and completely obscure - to find songs 
					with interesting musical similarities to your choice. Then sit back and enjoy 
					as it creates a listening experience full of current and soon-to-be favorite 
					songs for you.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span style="font-weight: 900; font-style: italic;">Billboard Top Ten</span> 
					is headquartered in Rexburg, Idaho 
					and has editorial correspondents in major cities around the globe.
