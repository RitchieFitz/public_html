					<h2>About Artist</h2>
					<div class="artist-info">
						<p>
							Mark Ronson is a sought-after turntablist who's worked with such diverse 
							artists as Macy Gray, Jay-Z, and comedian Jimmy Fallon. The stepson of 
							guitarist Mick Jones of Foreigner, Ronson spent the first eight years of 
							his life growing up in England. Having played guitar and drums from an early 
							age, it wasn't until moving to New York City with his mother that Ronson 
							discovered DJ culture. At age 16, already a fan of such popular hip-hop 
							artists as Run-D.M.C. and the Beastie Boys, Ronson began listening to the 
							various hip-hop mixtapes released every few months by DJs. Inspired, Ronson 
							confiscated his father's record collection and began trying his hand at mixing.
						</p>
						<p>
							The young DJ with the diverse taste soon caught the ears and eyes of 
							various socialites and New York celebrities, including fashion designer 
							Tommy Hilfiger, who featured Ronson, along with other sons and daughters 
							of celebrities, in a 1997 fashion campaign. A year later, hip-hop mogul 
							Sean "P. Diddy" Combs hired Ronson to DJ his fabled 29th birthday bash. 
							These and other high-profile gigs boosted Ronson's "hip quotient" and 
							helped promote his more serious-minded music career. Fusing his eclectic 
							turntable skills with his knowledge of musical instruments and 
							songwriting, Ronson eventually embarked on his first solo project. 
							Featuring such diverse guest artists as dancehall rapper Sean Paul, hip-
							hop artist Mos Def, Jack White of the White Stripes, and Rivers Cuomo of 
							Weezer, Ronson's debut album, Here Comes the Fuzz, appeared on Elektra in 
							2003.
						</p>
						<p>
							After releasing his debut album, Ronson kept busy producing tracks for a 
							number of artists including Amy Winehouse, whose 2006 album Back to Black 
							earned critical praise in large part for Ronson's throwback, Motown-influenced 
							production. His own sophomore effort, a collection of cover songs called 
							Version, dropped in 2007. In 2010, Ronson began performing under the moniker 
							Mark Ronson &amp; the Business Intl and released his third studio album, Record 
							Collection, featuring the single "Bang Bang Bang." Taking time out in 2011 
							to marry French actress and singer Jos√©phine de La Baume, Ronson wouldn't 
							return to the studio until 2013 to start work on his fourth album, Uptown 
							Special. Featuring collaborations with the likes of Bruno Mars, Mystikal, 
							Tame Impala's Kevin Parker, Hudson Mohawke, and Simian Mobile Disco's James 
							Ford, Uptown Special also featured lyrics written by novelist Michael Chabon. 
							The album was released in January 2015. ~ Matt Collar, Rovi

					<h2>About Artist</h2>
					<div class="artist-info">
						<p>
							Flame-haired singer/songwriter, beatboxer, and guitarist Ed Sheeran's eclectic 
							blend of acoustic pop, folk, and hip-hop has been championed by everyone from the 
							underground grime scene to American Oscar winners. Born in Halifax, West 
							Yorkshire, England in 1991, Sheeran released his first EP, The Orange Room, while 
							still at school, and his first two albums, his self-titled debut and Want Some, 
							by the age of 16. After moving to London to gain more live experience, his 
							performance of the self-penned "You Need Me, I Don't Need You" on YouTube channel 
							SB.tv gained half a million viewers and attracted the attention of actor/R&mp;B 
							star Jamie Foxx, who invited him to appear on his Los Angeles Sirius radio show.
						</p>
						<p>
							Securing a deal with Elton John's management company, he supported Example on his 
							U.K. tour and, after signing with Atlantic Records, he became only the third 
							artist to score a Top 75 album purely on download sales, when his No. 5 
							Collaborations project, a star-studded seven-track EP featuring Wiley, JME, and 
							Devlin, charted at number 47 in 2011. That same year he released his major debut 
							studio album, +. The album was a massive hit, selling over a million copies in 
							the U.K. alone in just six months, and charting highly in many other countries. 
							Sheeran then went about boosting his profile, co-writing songs for One Direction 
							and Taylor Swift. He toured the U.S. with Swift on her massive 2013 arena tour, 
							and saw his song "I See Fire" featured on the closing credits of the smash hit 
							movie The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. He then set about recording his 
							sophomore album with Rick Rubin and Pharrell producing. Keeping with the 
							mathematical theme, the album was titled X ("Multiply"). Appearing in June 2014, 
							X encompassed his acoustic/hip-hop hybrid sound, but also had an R&B feel in 
							places along with straight-ahead pop. The record debuted at number one on both 
							the U.S. and U.K. charts. ~ Jon O'Brien, Rovi

					<h2>About Artist</h2>
					<div class="artist-info">
						<p>
							Taylor Swift is that rarest of pop phenomenona: a superstar who managed to 
							completely cross over from country to the mainstream. Other singers performed 
							similar moves -- notably, Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson both became enduring 
							mainstream icons based on their '70s work -- but Swift shed her country roots 
							like they were a second skin; it was a necessary molting to reveal she was 
							perhaps the sharpest, savviest, populist singer/songwriter of her generation, one 
							who could harness the zeitgeist and turn it personal and, just as impressively, 
							perform the reverse. These skills were evident on her earliest hits, especially 
							the neo-tribute "Tim McGraw," but her second album, 2008's Fearless, showcased a 
							songwriter discovering who she was and, in the process, finding a mass audience. 
							Fearless wound up having considerable legs not only in the U.S., where it racked 
							up six platinum singles on the strength of the Top 10 hits "Love Story" and "You 
							Belong to Me," but throughout the world, performing particularly well in the U.
							K., Canada, and Australia. Speak Now, delivered almost two years later in the 
							autumn of 2010, consolidated that success and Swift moved into the stratosphere 
							of superstardom, with her popularity only increasing on 2012's Red and 2014's 
							1989, a pair of records that found her moving assuredly from country into a pop 
							realm where she already belonged.
						</p>
						<p>
							This sense of confidence had been apparent in Taylor Swift since the beginning. 
							The daughter of two bankers -- her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, works at Merrill 
							Lynch; her mother Andrea spent time as a mutual fund marketing executive -- Swift 
							was born in Reading, Pennsylvania and raised in its suburb Wyomissing. She began 
							to show interest in music at the age of nine and Shania Twain wound up as her 
							biggest formative influence. Swift started to work regularly at local talent 
							contests, eventually winning a chance to open for Charlie Daniels. Soon, she 
							learned how to play guitar and began writing songs, signing a music management 
							deal with Dan Dymtrow; her family relocated to Nashville with the intent of 
							furthering her music career. She was just 14 years old but on the radar of the 
							music industry, signing a development deal with RCA Records in 2004. Swift 
							sharpened her skills with a variety of professional songwriters, forming the 
							strongest connections with Liz Rose. Taylor's original songs earned her a deal 
							with Sony/ATV publishing but not long after that 2004 deal, she parted ways with 
							Dymtrow and RCA, all with the intent of launching her recording career now, not 
							later. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Things started moving swiftly once Swift came to the attention of Scott 
							Borchetta, a former DreamWorks Records exec about to launch Big Machine Records. 
							Borchetta saw Swift perform at a songwriters showcase at the Bluebird Cafe and he 
							signed her to Big Machine in 2005; shortly afterward, she started work on her 
							debut with producer Nathan Chapman, who'd previously helmed demos for Taylor. 
							Boasting original song credits on every one of the record's 11 songs (she penned 
							three on her own), Taylor Swift appeared in October 2006 to strong reviews and 
							Swift made sure to work the album hard, appearing at every radio or television 
							event offered and marshalling a burgeoning fan base through use of MySpace. "Tim 
							McGraw," the first song from the album, did well but "Teardrops on My Guitar" and 
							"Our Song" did better on both the pop charts and country, where she racked up 
							five consecutive Top 10 singles. Other successes followed in the wake of the 
							debut -- a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist (she lost to Amy Winehouse), 
							stopgap EPs of Christmas songs -- but Swift concentrated on delivering her 
							sophomore set, Fearless.

					<div class="artist-info">
						<p>
							A unique and intelligent singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist who cites 
							James Joyce's Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man, Leonard Cohen, John Lee 
							Hooker, and community choral singing among his influences, Hozier (his stage and 
							performing name) was born Andrew Hozier-Byrne on March 17, 1990 (which just so 
							happened to be St. Patrick's Day) in Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland. The son of a 
							local blues musician, he literally grew up with the blues being played all around 
							him. He joined his first band when he was 15, gravitating toward R&amp;B, soul, 
							gospel, and, of course, blues. Hozier started studying for a degree in music at 
							Trinity College Dublin, where he was involved with the Trinity Orchestra, but 
							dropped out in his first year to record demos for Universal Music. 
						</p>
						<p>
							From 2009 to 2012, he sang with An√∫na, an Irish choral group, and toured 
							internationally. He released a solo EP, Take Me to Church, in 2013, and when a 
							video for the powerful title track, which directly addresses gay discrimination 
							in Russia, went viral on YouTube and Reddit, Hozier found himself with an 
							international audience. A second EP, From Eden, appeared in the spring of 2014 
							and in September of that year, Columbia released his eponymous debut album. ~

					<h2>About Artist</h2>
					<div class="artist-info">
						<p>
							Pop singer and songwriter Meghan Trainor had already devoted most of her life to 
							music when she scored her first hit in 2014 (when she was 20 years old) with a 
							dance-friendly paean to body positivity, "All About That Bass." Born in December 
							1993, Trainor was born and raised on Nantucket Island in Massachusetts, where she 
							began making music when she was just seven, and wrote her first song at the age 
							of 11. Trainor attended high school at the Nauset High School on Cape Cod; there 
							she sang and played trumpet in the jazz band, and also studied guitar, taking 
							lessons with Johnny Spampinato, noted guitarist with NRBQ and the Incredible 
							Casuals. In addition, Trainor played guitar, keyboards, and sang with a local 
							Nantucket band called Island Fusion for four years. Trainor attended the Berklee 
							College of Music's Performance Program, a special five-week course, in 2009 and 
							2010, receiving high marks and reaching the finals of their songwriting 
							competition.
						</p>
						<p>
							By the time she was 18, Trainor had self-released three albums of her own 
							material and landed a publishing deal with Big Yellow Dog Music (who placed her 
							songs with artists such as Rascal Flatts, Macy Kate, Common Kings, and Sabrina 
							Carpenter) before she signed a deal with Epic Records. Trainor's first single for 
							Epic was "All About That Bass," in which she proudly declares she's "no stick 
							figure silicon Barbie doll," and "every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to 
							the top." The pastel-colored video for "All About That Bass" became an online 
							sensation, racking up over 1,600,000 views on YouTube within a month of its debut 
							in June 2014. Soon, "All About That Bass" started storming the Billboard Hot 100, 
							reaching the pole position not only in the U.S. but throughout the world. As it 
							racked up eight weeks on the top of the U.S. charts, it wound up getting 
							certified five times platinum, selling over four million copies in America alone; 
							international sales reached over six million, cementing "All About That Bass"' 
							status as one of the biggest singles of 2014. In comparison, its sequel, "Lips 
							Are Moving," paled, but it was still a notable hit, reaching four on the 
							Billboard charts and earning a gold certification, setting the stage nicely for 
							the January 2015 release of Trainor's debut, Title. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi

					<h2>About Artist</h2>
					<div class="artist-info">
						<p>
							A mix of polished pop/rock and neo-soul made Maroon 5 one of the most popular 
							bands of the new millennium, with songs like "This Love," "She Will Be Loved," 
							and "Makes Me Wonder" all topping the charts worldwide. Previously, bandmates 
							Adam Levine (vocals/guitar), Jesse Carmichael (keyboards), Mickey Madden (bass), 
							and Ryan Dusick (drums) had spent the latter half of the '90s playing in Kara's 
							Flowers, even releasing a debut album for Reprise Records while still attending 
							high school. The record tanked, however, and Kara's Flowers found themselves 
							dropped from Reprise's roster. After briefly attending college, the bandmates 
							regrouped as Maroon 5, adding former Square guitarist James Valentine to the 
							lineup and embracing a more R&B-influenced sound. Several years later, the 
							quintet had officially risen to the forefront of pop music with Songs About Jane 
							and It Won't Be Soon Before Long, both of which went multi-platinum. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Songs About Jane propelled the band into the mainstream, but the album was not an 
							immediate hit. Octone Records had signed the newly christened Maroon 5 in 2001, 
							and the debut album Jane received a lukewarm response upon its release in June 
							2002. "Harder to Breathe" became a radio staple 17 months later and was soon 
							followed by the omnipresent "This Love," whose steamy video (featuring frontman 
							Levine and a barely clothed girlfriend) wooed the TV-watching crowds at MTV. 
							Songs About Jane finally entered the Billboard Top Ten in August 2004, more than 
							two years after the album's release, and follow-up singles like "She Will Be 
							Loved" and "Sunday Morning" helped the album move over 2.7 million copies by 
							year's end. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Maroon 5 toured exhaustively in support of Jane's slow-burning success, issuing 
							two stopgap recordings -- 2004's 1.22.03.Acoustic and 2005's Live Friday the 13th 
							-- while traveling the world alongside the likes of the Rolling Stones and John 
							Mayer. Their schedule was especially trying on percussionist Dusick, who 
							sustained wrist and shoulder injuries and was often unable to play. By fall 2006, 
							Dusick had been officially replaced by Matt Flynn (the former drummer for Gavin 
							DeGraw), and the revised band released its sophomore effort in May 2007. It Won't 
							Be Soon Before Long proved to be less popular than its predecessor (which had 
							sold more than four million copies in the U.S. alone), but it still enjoyed double
							-platinum certification while spinning off the chart-topping single "Makes Me 
							Wonder." Maroon 5 had cemented their status as pop/rock heavy weights, and they 
							now had the connections to prove it. Released in late 2008, Call and Response: 
							The Remix Album reinterpreted the band's catalog with remixes by influential 
							producers like Mary J. Blige, Mark Ronson, and Pharrell Williams.

					<h2>About Artist</h2>
					<div class="artist-info">
						<p>
							As the unspoken leader of the Jonas Brothers, Nick Jonas attracted legions of 
							young fans with his fizzy, Disney-approved pop songs. The New Jersey native 
							wasn't the group's only frontman -- he shared that role with his older brother, 
							Joe -- but he was certainly the main songwriter, drawing upon his experience as a 
							childhood Broadway actor as well as his love of classic pop music for 
							inspiration. A performer since the age of seven (the age at which he joined the 
							Broadway cast of Annie Get Your Gun), Nicholas made his songwriting debut in 
							2002, when a holiday tune he'd co-written with his father found its way onto a 
							Broadway Christmas album. A contract with Columbia Records followed two years 
							later. Nicholas began prepping for his solo career by writing material with his 
							older brothers, Kevin and Joseph, who eventually climbed aboard as permanent 
							partners. Nick's solo project thus blossomed into a full-fledged band, and the 
							siblings aptly named themselves the Jonas Brothers. 
						</p>
						<p>
							It took several years for the Jonas Brothers to find an adoring audience. It's 
							About Time, the band's 2006 debut, was a commercial flop, and Columbia Records 
							dropped the group one year later. Signing with Hollywood Records in 2007, the 
							band began attracting new fans -- most of them young and female -- by 
							establishing a presence in the Disney world. They appeared on the network's 
							television shows, earned their own series, starred in a made-for-TV movie with 
							Disney starlet Demi Lovato, and sold close to two million copies of their self-
							titled sophomore album. They replicated that feat one year later with A Little 
							Bit Longer and returned in 2009 with Lines, Vines and Trying Times. All of the 
							albums featured heavy contributions from Nick, who not only led the songwriting 
							process but also played a wide variety of instruments, from drums to keyboard to 
							guitar. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Taking a rare break from the band, Nick Jonas began working with several other 
							musicians on a side project in late 2009. Members from Prince's New Power 
							Generation were recruited to join the lineup, including Michael Bland and Tommy 
							Barbarella, and the group dubbed itself Nick Jonas & the Administration before 
							making its debut in early 2010 with the album Who I Am. The record performed 
							respectably, peaking at three on the U.S. charts on its way to sales of 151,000, 
							but there were soon suggestions that Nick was planning to return to the Jonas 
							Brothers fold. This didn't happen. A 2013 tour was scrapped just prior to its 
							October launch and, soon afterward, the band split. Nick Jonas regrouped with a 
							2014 solo tour followed by the November release of an eponymous album. ~ Andrew 
							Leahey, Rovi

					<h2>About Artist</h2>
					<div class="artist-info">
						<p>
							Pop singer and songwriter Meghan Trainor had already devoted most of her life to 
							music when she scored her first hit in 2014 (when she was 20 years old) with a 
							dance-friendly paean to body positivity, "All About That Bass." Born in December 
							1993, Trainor was born and raised on Nantucket Island in Massachusetts, where she 
							began making music when she was just seven, and wrote her first song at the age 
							of 11. Trainor attended high school at the Nauset High School on Cape Cod; there 
							she sang and played trumpet in the jazz band, and also studied guitar, taking 
							lessons with Johnny Spampinato, noted guitarist with NRBQ and the Incredible 
							Casuals. In addition, Trainor played guitar, keyboards, and sang with a local 
							Nantucket band called Island Fusion for four years. Trainor attended the Berklee 
							College of Music's Performance Program, a special five-week course, in 2009 and 
							2010, receiving high marks and reaching the finals of their songwriting 
							competition.
						</p>
						<p>
							By the time she was 18, Trainor had self-released three albums of her own 
							material and landed a publishing deal with Big Yellow Dog Music (who placed her 
							songs with artists such as Rascal Flatts, Macy Kate, Common Kings, and Sabrina 
							Carpenter) before she signed a deal with Epic Records. Trainor's first single for 
							Epic was "All About That Bass," in which she proudly declares she's "no stick 
							figure silicon Barbie doll," and "every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to 
							the top." The pastel-colored video for "All About That Bass" became an online 
							sensation, racking up over 1,600,000 views on YouTube within a month of its debut 
							in June 2014. Soon, "All About That Bass" started storming the Billboard Hot 100, 
							reaching the pole position not only in the U.S. but throughout the world. As it 
							racked up eight weeks on the top of the U.S. charts, it wound up getting 
							certified five times platinum, selling over four million copies in America alone; 
							international sales reached over six million, cementing "All About That Bass"' 
							status as one of the biggest singles of 2014. In comparison, its sequel, "Lips 
							Are Moving," paled, but it was still a notable hit, reaching four on the 
							Billboard charts and earning a gold certification, setting the stage nicely for 
							the January 2015 release of Trainor's debut, Title. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi
