			<h2>Personal History</h2>
			<hr />
			<p>
				I was born in Grand Junction, Colorado, and raised in Moab, UT and Rexburg, ID. Since I was a kid there have been three areas of interest I have always had, science, math, and music. When I was in elementary school I auditioned and became a part of Rexburg Boy's Choir. That was a great experience for me. Since I was young I have always loved to play sports. I played every sport except soccer. When I was younger I was more into baseball and then it faded into Basketball. I have always loved watching football, but I didn't like playing it as much as the others.
			</p>
			<p>
				For a small time I attended Idaho Leadership Academy. It was really fun and interesting for the year and a half that I did it. We learned and studied a lot of classical works. We read classical books, and studied Euclid, and we were able to learn about a lot of the great leaders of the world. At the end of the first year I was chosen as the schools valedictorian. That was a great honor. After this though I missed the social scene of public school and everything it had to offer for different activities and groups.
			</p>
			<p>
				I graduated from Madison Senior High School in Rexburg, ID. A lot of people have mixed emotions about High School. I personally loved my high school years. I was able to take part in a lot of different groups while I was there. I was able to get a spot in the top classical choir, and showtime choir. I was able to to take part in a lot of our schools musicals as supporting leads, and in one of them the main lead. Here is a list of the plays I was in and the roles I played. Starting from first to last.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Handsel &amp; Gretel - Choir Boy - 3rd Grade.</li>
				<li>Oliver - Orphan Boy - 4th Grade.</li>
				<li>The Sound of Music - Frederick (Captain's oldest son) - 8th Grade.</li>
				<li>Hello Dolly - Choir Member - 9th Grade.</li>
				<li>Brigadoon - Charlie (The one who get's married) - 10th Grade.</li>
				<li>Guys &amp; Dolls - Nicely Nicely Johnson - 11th Grade.</li>
				<li>Pirates of Penzance - Frederic (main lead) - 11th Grade.</li>
				<li>Fiddler on the Roof - Motel (the tailor) - 12th Grade.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				While in the classical choir, our choir was chosen from 100â€²s of other highschool's from across the country to perform in Carnegie Hall in New York City. It was so fun to see the big city coming from a small community in Idaho it was incredible. While in High School I was chosen to be Junior Class Senator, and Senior Class Vice President. Both awesome opportunities to take a part in, and learning about leadership roles. Besides choir I also joined the debate team and me and my partner took 2nd place at one championship, sadly I only participated my junior year, but it was fun while it lasted. One of my funnest events in high school was called Mr. Madison. I don't know if your school has something similar to these events but the girls in Idaho take part of an event called Junior Miss (it is a beauty pageant like Miss America), and Mr. Madison just makes fun of Junior Miss. Not that it means very much but I won, and it was the funnest funniest thing I have taken a part in.
			</p>
			<p>
				After high school I got accepted into <a href="http://byui.edu">BYU-I</a>. When I first started I didn't really know what I was going to major in but computers was definitely at the top of the list. After my second course in computer science I decided that was the course that I wanted to take. While attending BYU-I I met my wife Hannah Walker, and not even two years later we had our first child. Her name is Leah. I thought that it would be harder to continue learning being married and having kid so young, but that would be wrong. If anything I now have more ambition and wanting to learn more so that I can provide for my family. In my life I have always decided to put family first, work second. Family is the single most important thing to me, and if a future employer disagrees then I won't think twice about turning down an offer.

			<h2>Computer Science History</h2>
			<hr />
			<p>
				I started getting interested in Computer Science when I was about 12 years old. My cousin, Richard, and I started making games with GameMaker. It was a lot of fun as a kid, and I enjoyed watching others play the games I made. Since then my passion for learning more about computers has increased exponentially. I didn't really do much more than that since I was a kid till college.
			</p>
			<p>
				At college I was trying to decide what to major in because I had a lot of different interests. Computers stuck out to me, and I decided to give it a try. My first class was the hardest. My class at first had 30-40 kids in it, but in the end it ended up being around 5-8. I learned a lot, but I really fell in love with it in my second class. After that I decided that that is what I needed to do. I now am getting my major in Computer Information Technologies and my minor in Computer Science. My first internship was with Barton Consulting, they build websites, it was fun to get into that realm more and now I can easily build a websites using many different tools. I also worked for AMD as a computer scientist, building a python GUI program to help them validate certain things. It was an awesome project and I was able to learn a lot.
			</p>
			<p>
				Along the way I have been using and teaching myself many different languages, and I haven't used all of these in building projects but I have used all of them in coding before.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>C++</li>
				<li>JAVA</li>
				<li>HTML5</li>
				<li>CSS3</li>
				<li>JAVASCRIPT</li>
				<li>JQUERY</li>
				<li>PHP</li>
				<li>PYTHON</li>
				<li>RUBY</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The ones I have built real programs for have been Java, HTML5, CSS3, PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, python and ruby. I have learned all I know though with C++. Learning C++ was helpful because I know what is going on more behind the scenes with these other languages. To see more what I have done look at my portfolio page and resume for a detailed work history and you could even take a look at my linkedin page.
